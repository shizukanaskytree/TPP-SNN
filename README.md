# TPP-SNN

The full codebase for our ICML 2025 paper "Temporal Misalignment in ANN-SNN Conversion and Its Mitigation via Probabilistic Spiking Neurons" is coming soon. For a quick start, you can directly access and explore the core implementation via [TPP-SNN Code (QCFS)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1luBWzrAoA5oZzsTL3wVFmlTe-ZRYnW80)
